## Homework

### Gossip Algorithms over different network topologies

A brief description of three different gossip algorithms, Probabilistic Broadcast, Probabilistc Edge, Fixed Fanout, with detailed example on how do they can work over different network topologies, (Erdosâ€“Renyi, Random Geometric, Scale free), and some example from real world.

## The project

### Complete The Wolfram Expression

An interactive browser game where you can improve your skill with wolfram language, starting from a topic of your intrest the system will show you a Wolfram Expression with a missing part to complete, in a growing of difficulty and fun.
