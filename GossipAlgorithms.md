# Gossip Algorithms over different network topologies

A brief description of three different gossip algorithms, Probabilistic Broadcast, Probabilistc Edge, Fixed Fanout, with detailed example on how do they can work over different network topologies, (Erdosâ€“Renyi, Random Geometric, Scale free), and some example from real world.
