# Complete The Wolfram Expression

An interactive browser game where you can improve your skill with wolfram language, starting from a topic of your intrest the system will show you a Wolfram Expression with a missing part to complete, in a growing of difficulty and fun.

## Goal
The primary goal  of this project is adding question mark in a random point of one of the expressions of the documentation of Mathematica and present it to the user alongside it's output.
When user solve the problem the system give him a score related with his performance and present him another problem related with the first.

## Poject Step

* Design a generator of problem
* Create a mock-up for the web application
* Create the web application with Wolfram Cloud's Api
* Design a sand-box that can run solutions proposed by users
* Design a graph of problem that user can explore from documentation
* Design different step of complessity in the game, multiple choice, lenght of the missing part, only position 
* Design a system of Karma Point, Badge and progression in the game
* Improve layout and user experience
